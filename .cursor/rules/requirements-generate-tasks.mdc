# Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

## Goal

You are a technical writer tasked with creating a detailed step-by-step task list in a markdown file, based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list will guide junior developers and AI assistants in developing a product that delivers on all the goals required for the PRD. 

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/project_docs/tasks-list.md`

## Process

1. `grep search` for a `prd.md` if not found ask the user to create one then stop.

2. `grep search` for a [example-task-list.md](mdc:project_docs/example-task-list.md) This should have detailed instructions for creating the `task-list.md`. If none exists, stop and ask the user to provide one.

3.  Analyze the `prd.md`. The goal is to break down the requirements into project milestones. Then to further break down the milestones into tasks, nodes, and   functions that junior developers and AI assistants can use to build a product that delivers on the goals of the `prd.md`.

4. Generate milestones. These are main high-level parent tasks that represent significant milestones required to deliver the goals of the `prd.md`

5. Generate tasks. These are any one off tasks outside of constructing nodes and functions. (Project setup, research, schema design ...) 

6. Generate nodes.

7. Generate functions.

8. Add `TBC` (to be confirmed) markers to flag any points of ambiguity that require clarification. `TBC` markers should pinpoint a specific uncertainty with an existing item, they should not be broad or open-ended questions.

Example of a TBC item. 
*   This is the item the TBC relates to. 
    > ⚠️ **TBC:** Please clarify ...

9. Review functions. Check if any functions share similar behaviour. If yes, can these functions be decomposed into smaller components which then can be leveraged by other functions.

10. Review functions more. Check if any functions can forfill the role of other functions if they are extended with additional parameters. If yes, extend those functions and then remove redundant ones.

11. For each node list the functions the node will leverage.

12. Save the `tasks-list.md` to `/project_docs/tasks-list.md`
