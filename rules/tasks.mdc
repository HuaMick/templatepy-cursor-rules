## Definition

A task is a specific, actionable item that does not involve creating or updating software components. 

These include:
- decisions
- researching
- project setup
- installing dependancies
- defining data schemas or configurations

## Guidelines

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep tasks separate from the implementation of functions, workflows, classes, and services. A task might be "Define the schema for X," while a separate function/workflow would be "Implement the process that uses the schema for X."
