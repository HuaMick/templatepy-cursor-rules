- All scripts should be designed to be run from the project root directory.

## Shell Scripts that execute workflows
- Please follow the patterns in @example_workflow_script.sh.

## Shell Scripts that execute tests
- Please follow the patterns in @example_test_integration.sh.
- Shell scripts that use pytest should not need to modify the PYTHONPATH they simply runs the test using python -m pytest from the project root.

- After creating a shell script you should grant permission to run the shell script. e.g. `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
