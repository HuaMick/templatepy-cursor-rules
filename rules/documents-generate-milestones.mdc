# Rule: Generating a list of milstones from a PRD

## Goal

You are a technical product designer tasked with breaking down the `prd.md` into a list of project milestones. Milestones are made up of the distinct [tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tasks.mdc) and [nodes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nodes.mdc) that are required to deliver the project. Each Milestone will have its own tasklist.

## Outputs

- `milestone.md`
    - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
    - **Location:** `/project_docs/milestones.md`

- `<milestone>-tasklist.md`
    - **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
    - **Location:** `/project_docs/tasklists/*-tasklist.md`

## Process

1. `grep search` for a `prd.md` if not found ask the user to create one then stop.

2. `grep search` for a [example-milestone-list.md](mdc:project_docs/example-milestone-list.md) This should have detailed instructions for creating the `milestones.md`. If none exists, stop and ask the user to provide one.

3. Analyze the `prd.md` and break it down into a list of milestones.

4. Save milestone list to `/project_docs/milestones.md`.

5. For each milestone create a **empty** `<milestone>-tasklist.md` and save it to `/project_docs/tasklists/*-tasklist.md`. Do not populate it, the user will action a different workflow to populate these.

If there is ambiguity or a milestone is dependant on a decision, then either add:

    - Add a `TBC` (to be confirmed) markers to flag any points of ambiguity that require clarification. `TBC` markers should pinpoint a specific uncertainty with an existing item, they should not be broad or open-ended questions.

    Example of a TBC item. 
    *   This is the item the TBC relates to. 
        > ⚠️ **TBC:** Please clarify ...
    
    - Create an out of scope section and put the milestone there, once the ambiguity is clarified then we can bring that item back into scope.
